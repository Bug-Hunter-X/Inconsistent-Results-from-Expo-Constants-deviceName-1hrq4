# Inconsistent Results from Expo Constants.deviceName

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `Constants.deviceName` property in Expo's Constants API returns unexpected values, such as an empty string or null, instead of the actual device name.  This behavior is inconsistent and not easily reproducible.

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to access `Constants.deviceName`.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a workaround to handle potential null or empty string cases.

## Bug Report

The `Constants.deviceName` property in Expo, intended to provide the device's name, has shown unexpected behavior.  On certain occasions, it returns an empty string or null, leading to application errors or unexpected results.  This inconsistency makes it difficult to rely on the data this API provides for features dependent on device identification.

## Potential Causes

* Timing issues or asynchronous operations in Expo's initialization.
* Inconsistent data retrieval across different device models or operating systems.
* Underlying issues within the Expo SDK related to device information retrieval.
