This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants API to access device information.  Specifically, the `Constants.deviceName` property sometimes returns an unexpected value, an empty string, or null, instead of the actual device name. This inconsistency can lead to unpredictable behavior in applications that rely on this information for personalization or device-specific logic. The issue appears to be intermittent and not consistently reproducible across different devices or Expo SDK versions.
